## Using a fixed expression

One example case is when you want to split on a period "`.`".  In regular expressions `.` means **ANY** character, so

```{r}
str_split("I.like.strings", ".")
str_split("I.like.strings", fixed("."))
```

## Let's extract from `y`

The `purrr` package allows you to more easily interface with lists.

The main function family for this is `map()`

## Let's extract from `y`

`map_chr()` takes a list and returns a character vector 

```{r stsplit2}
map_chr(y, first) # on the fly
map_chr(y, nth, 2) # on the fly
map_chr(y, last) # on the fly
```
