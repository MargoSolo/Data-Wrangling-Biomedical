## Explaining output on slides

In slides, a command (we'll also call them code or a code chunk) will look like this
```{r code}
print("I'm code")
```

And then directly after it, will be the output of the code.  
So `print("I'm code")` is the code chunk and [1] "I'm code" is the output. 

These slides were made in R using `knitr` and `R Markdown` (covered later today when we discuss reproducible research)

## Data Input

* 'Reading in' data is the first step of any real project/analysis
* R can read almost any file format, especially via add-on packages
* We are going to focus on simple delimited files first
    * tab delimited (e.g. '.txt')
    * comma separated (e.g. '.csv')
    * Microsoft excel (e.g. '.xlsx')

## Data Input

UFO Sightings via Kaggle.com: "Reports of unidentified flying object reports in the last century". 

"There are two versions of this dataset: scrubbed and complete. The complete data includes entries where the location of the sighting was not found or blank (0.8146%) or have an erroneous or blank time (8.0237%). Since the reports date back to the 20th century, some older data might be obscured. Data contains city, state, time, description, and duration of each sighting."

## Data Input
* Download data from http://sisbid.github.io/Module1/data/ufo/ufo_data_complete.csv.gz
* Upload the data to RStudio Cloud 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_upload.png")
```

## Data Input

<!-- R Studio features some nice "drop down" support, where you can run some tasks by selecting them from the toolbar. -->

Easy way: import text datasets using the "File --> Import Dataset --> From Text (readr)" command. Selecting this will bring up a new screen that lets you specify the formatting of your text file. 

Going through this process enters the corresponding R commands in the console (you can copy these for later!)

## Data Input

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_file_menu_RStudiocloud.png")
```

## Data Input

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_file_import_browser_RStudiocloud.png")
```

## Data Input

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_file_import_browse_RStudiocloud.png")
```

## Data Input

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_file_import_preview_RStudiocloud.png")
```

## Data Input

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_file_import_console_code.png")
```

## Commenting in Scripts

Commenting in code is super important. You should be able to go back to your code years after writing it and figure out exactly what the script is doing. Commenting helps you do this. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_comments_to_self.png")
```

## Commenting in Scripts

Add a comment header to your script from today:`#` is the comment symbol

```{r}
#################
# Title: Demo R Script
# Date: 7/13/2020
# Purpose: Demonstrate comments in R
###################
 
# nothing to its right is evaluated
x = 2 # but the left will be

# this # is still a comment
### you can use many #s as you want
##### 5 #s or more make a collapsible section 

# sometimes if you have a really long comment,
# you can take it to another line
```

## R variables 

* You can create variables from within the R environment and from files on your computer
* R uses "=" or "<-" to assign values to a variable name
* Variable names are case-sensitive, i.e. X and x are different

```{r assign}
x = 2 # Same as: x <- 2
x
x * 4
x + 2
```

## Help

For any function, you can write `?FUNCTION_NAME`, or `help("FUNCTION_NAME")` to look at the help file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?dir
help("dir")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/IO_help.png")
```

## Data Input

Initially-harder-but-gets-way-easier method: Utilizing functions in the `readr` package called `read_delim()` and `read_csv()` with code.

## Data Input

So what is going on "behind the scenes"?

`read_delim()`: Read a delimited file into a data frame.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
args(readr::read_delim)
```

```{r eval=FALSE} 
# example: 
read_delim(file = "file.txt", delim = "\t") 
read_delim("file.txt", "\t")
```

## Data Input

* The filename is the path to your file, in quotes
* The function will look in your "working directory" if no absolute file path is given
* Note that the filename can also be a path to a file on a website (e.g. 'www.someurl.com/table1.txt')


## Data Input

There is another convenient function for reading in CSV files, where the delimiter is assumed to be a comma: 

```{r readCSV2}
ufo = read_csv("../data/ufo/ufo_data_complete.csv")
```

<!-- The data is now successfully read into your R workspace, just like from using the dropdown menu. -->

## Data Input

The `read_delim()` and related functions return a "tibble" is a `data.frame` with special printing, which is the primary data format for most data cleaning and analyses. 

```{r viewInput, message=FALSE}
class(ufo)
```

## Data Input

```{r, viewTibble}
ufo
```

## Data Input

There are also data importing functions provided in base R (rather than the `readr` package), like `read.delim` and `read.csv`. 

These functions have slightly different syntax for reading in data, like `header` and `as.is`. 

However, while many online resources use the base R tools, recent versions of RStudio switched to use these new `readr` data import tools, so we will use them in the class for slides. They are also up to two times faster for reading in large datasets, and have a progress bar which is nice. 


## Data Input - Excel

Many data analysts collaborate with researchers who use Excel to enter and curate their data. Often times, this is the input data for an analysis. You therefore have two options for getting this data into R:

* Saving the Excel sheet as a .csv file, and using `read_csv()`
* Using an add-on package, like `readxl`, the `read_excel` function

For single worksheet .xlsx files, better to keep the XLSX file as the raw data as Excel exporting CSV can make slight changes (but I often have to strip off additional summary data from the columns).

## Data Input - Other Software

* `haven` package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/index.html) reads in SAS, SPSS, Stata formats
* `sas7bdat` reads .sas7bdat files
* `sf` & `rgdal` read in spatial data
* `pdftools` reads .pdf, but things can get tricky quickly

## Common new user mistakes we have seen

1.  **Working directory problems: trying to read files that R "can't find"**
    - RStudio can help, and so do RStudio Projects
2.  Lack of comments in code
3.  Typos (R is **case sensitive**, `x` and `X` are different)
    - RStudio helps with "tab completion"
4.  Data type problems (is that a string or a number?)
5.  Open ended quotes, parentheses, and brackets    
    
## Working Directories

* R "looks" for files on your computer (or cloud) relative to the "working" directory
* Best practice is to double-click an R file to start a new RStudio session, instead of launching RStudio from Desktop or somewhere else.
  - it sets the working directory to match that file
  - RStudio Cloud can simplify things
* If you do set a working directory, do it at the beginning of your script. 
* Example of getting and setting the working directory:

```{r workingDirectory,eval=FALSE}
## get the working directory
getwd()
setwd("~/Lectures") 
```
