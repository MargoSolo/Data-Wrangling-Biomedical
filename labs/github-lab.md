### Github lab for SISBID


1. First we need to set up Git/Github. Here are a good set of instructions:http://stat545.com/git00_index.html. When telling Git your name and email
address you need to run the commands in the shell. You can do this with Tools -> Shell in Rstudio. 

2. Use the approach discussed in class to clone the data sharing repo: https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing

3. Create a Github repo with title _yourname_new_project_

4. Now create a fresh project from version control in the SISBID space on rstudio.cloud. Call it _yourname_new_project_. 

4. Create a file in the directory called "test.md" and write some stuff in it. 

5. Click on Github menu -> Commit or follow the instructions from before to add and commit. 

6. Click next to "test.md", write a comment in the comment box and click "Commit"

10. You are all set up!

11. Try adding another file `test2.md` and write some stuff in it. 

12. Add it by following Steps 5-6, but with `test2.md` to commit. 

13. Now click on the "Push" button in the Rstudio menu. This will push your new file up

14. On https://github.com/yourusername/your_new_project click on the place where it says something like "3 commits". You can see each of the changes you have made. 

15. If you are done and want to go big, find a partner and do this exercise: https://github.com/kbroman/Tools4RR/blob/master/05_Git_Lab/git_lab.md
