to learn more about using GitHub

### Part 2

Within RStudio Cloud:

1. Create a new RStudio Cloud project from this Github repo
- First get the URL using the Clone/Download button on Github
- Then create a new project from Git repo on rstudio.cloud
- You may be prompted for your username and password

2. Create a file README.md in this new repo. Check out the `usethis` package, specifically the usethis::use_readme_rmd() function

3. Add, commit, and push this file as described in the class or using the Github menu

4. Look at the url https://github.com/[username]/hello-world to confirm the file is there. 

5. Create the set of directories as described in the course notes in the folder on rstudio.cloud (data/code/writing etc.) 

6. Commit, add and push this folder structure. What do you see? 

7. On https://github.com/[username]/hello-world click on the place where it says something like "3 commits". You can see each of the changes you have made. 

8. Create a "release" for this repository: https://github.com/[username]/hello-world/releases
