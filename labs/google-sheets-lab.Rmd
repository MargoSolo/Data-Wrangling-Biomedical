This is a lab to practice with Google Sheets and the `googlesheets` package.

1. If you haven't already go to the class Google Sheet and add your information:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJ_k8krqoO5E7L5vjEMjB3vMoMcBRmAzxQ5tkJodT34/

2. Use the `googlesheets` package to read in the data like we discussed in class. 

3. Look at the arguments for `cell_rows`, `cell_limits` and `cell_cols`. 

4. Try reading in just the first two columns. 

5. How many students are in the class (or at least have added their information to the Sheet)?

6. Create a logical variable for whether students have more than 2 years of R experience

7. Convert the logical variable from \#6 into a factor with labels "Skilled" and "Learning"
